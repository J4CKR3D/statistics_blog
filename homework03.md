### Researches about theory (R)  

#### 7_R. 
First, we are going to discuss about **marginal**, **joint** and **conditional** distribution, so given 2 variables X and Y we can describe those distributions as follows:
 - **Marginal**: By *marginal distribution* we mean the a subset of a collection in a bivariate distribution table (usually situated in the most right row and in the bottom row) and are indicated by the **Total** lable, so it refers to the total occurrencies of an Y variable in all the X variable columns, and the total of each X variable columns, in all the Y variable rows.

 - **Joint**: With *Joint Distribution* we mean all the single values contained in the X,Y cells, so given 2 sets of variables X, Y, the joint distribution is a probability ditribution that each of X,Y land in any particular range or discrete set of values specified for that variable.

 - **Conditional**: Given two *jointly distributed* 
random variables X and Y, we mean by conditional distribution of **Y** given **X** as the probability distribution of Y when we expect X to be a particular value.

A pratical example below for the *Marginal* and *Joint* distribution:

The values in the orange box, are the Marginal distribution value, the purple one are the Joint distribution value.
