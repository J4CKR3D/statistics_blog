### Researches about theory (R)
#### **1_R.** 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_population) describes Statistical population as follows
> In statistics, a population is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment. A statistical population can be a group of existing objects (e.g. the set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience (e.g. the set of all possible hands in a game of poker). A common aim of statistical analysis is to produce information about some chosen population. 

So we can define statistical population as a set of similiar existing or hypotetical object/events which study of the related data seems interesting for questions/experiments

In **descriptive statistics**, the population is intented to be a set of object on wich features will be noted and organized and used for the data analysis. In descriptive statistics, *dataset* is usually a precise description of the population attributes.

In **inferential statistics**, the population is actually composed just by a sample (so a subset) of the larger group, on wich data is harvested and used for the inference of the entire population. The main difference is that inferential statistics creates it's *dataset* only on a sample of the population and uses that data (known) to infer on the whole population (unknown). 

The main differneces in the two population is that:  
  - Descriptive Statistics analyze data and describes statistics of the entire population,  
  - On the other hand Inferential statistics aims to analyze data of a sample to make (as the name says) inference on the entire population.  
  
#### **2_R.**  
  -  We can describe **statistical attributes** as a specific characteristic of an object, like age, weigth or height;  
  - **statistical variables** on the other hand are logical sets of attributes that (as the name suggests) may vary, those can be conisdered a representation of attributes for a further data processing;  
  The two terms are *interchangeable* anyway.
  - With the term **Dataset** we describe a collection of data organized (usually) as a table, each column corresponds to a *variable* and each row corresponds to a given member of the dataset.  
  
#### **3_R.**  
   - A **univariate dataset** consists in a single attribute dataset, so we will have a single column table containing just the attribute we want to examine; For example, if we want to create a univariate dataset containing the weights of 10 apples we use the weight attribute of the apple to create the 1 column-10 rows dataset containing the data.
 - The number of occurence of a specific value for a specific attribute is known as **frequency ditribution**.  
 For example, we have this weight array (in grams):  
 ```w={22.0, 32.2, 44.3, 32.2, 21.9, 32.3, 22.0}```  
 we know that the distribution of 32.2 is 3/7.


  - Actually no, wen we use the dataset to create a distribution frequency, we lose part of the information.

 - The difference between the two amounts of data is actually considerable, in the dataset we have a **complete** correlation betwen attribute values and statistical units, on the other hand with the distribution we have a concise and brief version of the same data but with a loss in the correlation between statistical units and related values (as said in the previous point). We gain knowledge by losing information.
