### Researches about theory (R)
  1_R. 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_population) describes Statistical population as follows
> In statistics, a population is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment. A statistical population can be a group of existing objects (e.g. the set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience (e.g. the set of all possible hands in a game of poker). A common aim of statistical analysis is to produce information about some chosen population. 

So we can define statistical population as a set of similiar existing or hypotetical object/events which study of the related data seems interesting for question/experiments

In **descriptive statistics**, the population is intented to be a sample of a larger group (population) on wich features will be noted and organized and used for te data analysis.  

In **inferential statistics**, the population is also a sample of a larger population on wich data is harvested and used for the inference of a larger population.  

The main differneces in the two population samples is that:  
  - Descriptive Statistics analyze data and describes statistics of the sample ONLY,  
  - On the other hand Inferential statistics aims to analyze data of a sample to make (as the name says) inference on the larger population.
