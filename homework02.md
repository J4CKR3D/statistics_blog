> Level of measurement or scale of measure is a classification that describes the nature of information within the values assigned to variables.

The levels of classification has been developed by Stanley Smith Stevens those levels are 4 in total: **nominal**, **ordinal**, **interval**, and **ratio**.
This is an overview of the differencies between the various levels:  
| Incremental progress | Measure property |Mathematical operators | Advanced operations | Central tendency | 
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Nominal|Classification, membership|=, ≠|Grouping|Mode|
|Ordinal|Comparison, level|>, <|Sorting|Median|
|Interval|Difference, affinity|+, −|Yardstick|Mean, Deviation|
|Ratio|Magnitude, amount|×, /|Ratio|Geometric mean, Coefficient of variation|  

We could group those 4 levels in 2 main categories, **Qualitative** and **Quantitative** measurements:
 - **Qualitative**
    - **Nominal level**:
    In Nominal level, the variables can be divided into categories, as for example AM or PM hours
    - **Ordinal level**:
    Same is for the Ordinal level, variables can be categorized, but in this case the categories must be ordered too, for example grades like A+(31), A(29-30), B(26-28), ecc
 - **Quantitative**
    - **Interval level**: 
    The interval level is useful to define a degree of difference between items (not ratio) with an arbitrary zero. We could think about it as a numerica range. An example could be the temperature, more precisely the Celsius scale with a defined freezing and boiling point of water.
    - **Ratio level**: A Ratio scale possesses a meaningful and non-arbitrary zero value and doesn't have any kind of interval. It consists in an estimation between the magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind, so it's an "how much" measurement (informally). An example could be the temperature or other measurements of this kind.  
    
As the 2 main groups says, we can say that the levels in the **Qualitative** group can give us informationa about the Quality of the variables (like grades as i said in the example above), *Nominal* level gives us a classification of the variables, the *Ordinal* level is more of a comparison instead. **Quantitative** group level gives us more information about differencies in quantity of the variables, like the *interval* level or a certain amount like *Ratio* level.
